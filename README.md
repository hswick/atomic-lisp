# atomic-lisp
Small lisp written in C++ and Solidity

Currently there is a C++ version that supports these keycommands:
`do` - evaluate all args sequentially
`def` - define a variable in the global environment
`set!` - change the variable
`fn` - Return a lambda ((args)(body))
`()` - Call a procedure

Supports both floating point and integer arithmetic
`+`
`-`
`*`
`/`

strings.sol gives a lot of warnings right now
